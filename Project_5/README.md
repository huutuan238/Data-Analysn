# GoBike System Data Exploration
## by Nguyen Huu Tuan


## Dataset

> The project is divided into two parts. 
> - In the first part, I  will using Python libraries  for data science and visualization, conduct exploratory data analysis on the Ford GoBike System Data dataset . Learning about data helps me understand the structure of the data set, identify any anomalies, spot patterns, and discover correlations between variables. I will begin by examining individual variables and gradually expand to investigate relationships between multiple variables.

> - In the second part of the project, I will focus on communicating the key findings obtained from the exploratory analysis to others through an explanatory approach. To accomplish this, I will create a presentation that incorporates cleverly designed visualizations intended to communicate results effectively.


## Summary of Findings

> Service usage times during the day are usually during peak hours. they use the service to move for different purposes such as work, study, trade. The proportion of male bikers is also the majority, in addition, about age, people aged 20-39 have the largest proportion. People often use the service on weekdays and rarely use it on weekends. Also Subscribers' average trip duration is ~ 650 seconds and Customers' average trip duration is ~ 1300 seconds.


## Key Insights for Presentation

### Distribution of Age
> The majority of riders are male and account for about 75%, and female riders account for about 23%.


### Bike rider per weekday
> Fewer people ride on weekends than during the week.


### Using Times of Biker
> With three completely different variables such as people, time frames, days of the week to explore relationship and find something interested.
